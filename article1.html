        <h3>Turbochargers</h3>
        <p>Turbochargers uses exhaust fumes to produce additional power for combustion engines. The hot exhaust gases are blown over a turbine, causing it to spin. This drives an impeller, which in-turn drives a compressor. This sucks in additional air, which is cooled before being forced into the engine cylinders. The additional high-pressure air leads to more fuel being burned in the same stroke, as there is more air per-unit volume. The result of burning more fuel is increased power output.  Originally, turbochargers were a very widely used tool in aviation. Naturally aspirated engines always had their power dramatically reduced at high altitude, where air density was much lower than at sea-level. Turbochargers were used to 'recover' the lost power and thus 'normalise' (turbo-normalising) the engine power output. The main issue with turbochargers, is the lag between hitting the throttle and gaining additional power. This lag occurs because the turbocharger needs to spool up before it can begin delivering high-pressure air to the engine. This requires a certain amount of exhaust fume flow, without which the turbocharger will not spool. There are a number of solutions to this issue that don't compromise performance too much. One popular solution is sequential turbocharging, where by a large turbocharger is deployed in tandem with a small turbocharger. This is a successful solution because the small turbocharger has a much smaller aspect ratio (ratio of turbine inlet Area to the impeller radius), which allows it to spool quickly and deliver high-pressure air to the engine whilst giving the larger turbocharger time to spool up and begin delivering high-pressure air to the engine. Another solution could be to use a high power battery or motor, as they do in Formula1, to 'pre-spool' the turbocharger when the throttle is closed. This battery could be easily recharged in breaking situations using regenerative braking systems. </p>

        <h3>Superchargers</h3>
        <p>Superchargers work in a very similar fashion to turbochargers. They also use increased air density to burn more fuel and therefore increase power output. However, superchargers do not use spent exhaust gases to drive a compressor. Instead, superchargers are mechanically driven by the engine using a chain or a belt connected to engine's crankshaft. This is an important difference because superchargers rely on engine revolutions to force more air into the cylinders, not exhaust gases. This means there is much less lag between demanding and getting additional power.</p>
        <h3>Who Wins?</h3>
        <p>Turbochargers are simply more efficient. Turbochargers use exhaust gases which would be otherwise wasted to produce more engine power. Where as superchargers are driven by the engine themselves and cannot harness the waste exhaust. Furthermore, there is more associated mechanical friction in most supercharger systems than turbocharger systems. Having said this, we have established that turbochargers have inherent lag between demanding more power and the turbo spooling up to working speed. Althought this is fixable the solutions generally are more expensive and also heavier. Superchargers don't suffer from the same issue. As well as this, superchargers are easy to tune and have a large operating band. Turbochargers have a key metric called boost threshold. This is the minimum engine speed required to get the turbocharger up to working speed, forcing air into the cylinders. Finally, the operating range of turbochargers is much shorter than the operating range of superchargers. A low aspect ratio restricts flow capacity and hence reduces the upper bound of operating engine speed. However, the smaller turbine size means a lower boost threshold and hence reduces the lower bound of operating engine speed. On the other hand, a large aspect ratio gives you great top end performance (in part due to the large flow capacity) but the large boost threshold means there is a large lower bound of operating engine speed. In contrast, superchargers can have a very wide operating range of engine speeds.

        In my opinion, the superchargers win. Not only do they have a wider operating range of engine RPM, but they also don't suffer from lag and so, purely from a performance point of view, the supercharger must win in my eyes. This is not to say that turbochargers are useless. They are extremely useful and effective at increase intake air pressure. Plus... they sound pretty cool. </p>
